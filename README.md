# leaflet-challenge
In this project I was tasked with creating an interactive dashboard that includes a map that shows the latest earthquake data where the plot points represent the magnitude and the color represents its depth. This was done by using d3 to read data from United States Geological Survey (USGS). Additionally, I was tasked with creating a popup for each point that included additional data.
